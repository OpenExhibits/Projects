Open Exhibits Projects
========
[Open Exhibits](http://openexhibits.org/) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored initiative that looks to transform the way in which museums and other informal learning institutions produce and share computer-based exhibits. Open Exhibits is both a collection of software and a growing community of practice.

Please note that all Open Exhibits projects have been moved under [Ideum's Github account](https://github.com/ideum).
